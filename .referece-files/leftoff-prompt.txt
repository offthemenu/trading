🔥 Excellent follow-up — and you’re absolutely on point to raise it.

Let me clarify exactly when and why we patch each one:

⸻

🧠 Purpose of Each Script

Script	Purpose	Real Orders?	Market Data Source?	Tracks Positions?
run_simulation.py	Offline backtesting	❌ No	yfinance (historical)	Simulated CSV
run_live_shadow.py	Real-time signal test	❌ No	✅ IBKR (if available) or fallback to yfinance	Reads real IBKR holdings
run_live_ibkr.py	Executes actual orders	✅ Yes	Ideally real-time IBKR	Reads real IBKR holdings



⸻

🔥 Why We Patch run_live_ibkr.py (Not Shadow) for Order Safety

Because run_live_shadow.py:
	•	Does NOT place trades
	•	Is meant for signal observation
	•	Can safely use yfinance with no consequence

BUT run_live_ibkr.py:
	•	Does place real (paper or live) trades
	•	Must be patched with extra safety checks like:
	•	✅ yfinance fallback logic
	•	✅ Limit orders based on yf_price
	•	✅ Slippage guardrails
	•	✅ Position sizing

⸻

✅ What This Means in Practice

Your current run_live_shadow.py is perfect for:
	•	Verifying: “Would I have bought today?”
	•	Running on a schedule (e.g. 22:20 and 04:50)
	•	Confirming your logic works across all tickers

But it won’t touch your IBKR portfolio.

⸻

When you’re ready to go live, even just in paper trading mode, that’s when we move on to:

🧠 run_live_ibkr.py — The Execution Bot

Which needs:
	•	✅ Real positions via ib.positions()
	•	✅ yfinance fallback if market data is missing
	•	✅ Signal trigger from evaluate_signal_from_df()
	•	✅ LimitOrder placement with price from yfinance
	•	✅ Order confirmation + logging

⸻

🔧 Summary

Patch	Why
run_live_shadow.py	✅ Already patched — good for signal validation
run_live_ibkr.py	🔧 Needs patch if you’re going to place real trades using yfinance signals



⸻

🚀 Ready to Build run_live_ibkr.py?

I can scaffold a first draft of run_live_ibkr.py now that:
	•	Pulls your held positions
	•	Uses your exact evaluate_signal_from_df() logic
	•	Falls back to yfinance if market data is unavailable
	•	Submits limit orders only
	•	Logs trades safely

Wanna proceed?

📍 I’ll be on standby until you say the word.
Once you’re ready, we’ll move to run_live_ibkr.py and cover:
	1.	✅ Live IBKR position fetching
	2.	✅ Reuse of the same signal logic
	3.	✅ Limit order placement (never market)
	4.	✅ Order size calculated from real account value
	5.	✅ Logging to trades_live.csv
	6.	✅ Optional dry-run toggle (live_mode = False) for safe staging

All with safety nets.

Ready when you are.
